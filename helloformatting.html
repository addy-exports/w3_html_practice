    <h2><ins>Report from <b title="And edited by Susan Afton! They always cut me out of the byline!!">Caldwell Sanders</b>, Word Crimes Division</ins></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
       <b>At 5am this morning</b> police were called to an a house in the <ins>lower east district</ins> over reports of a strange
       and distorted text.
       Although authorities were at first <sup>s</sup>k<sub>e</sub>p<sup>t</sup>i<sub>c</sub>a<sup>l</sup>, memories of the Night of Fragmented Fonts ensured that this possible threat
       was at the very least investigated. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Upon arrival they recieved no answer at the door, however a <i>glimpse</i> of some unsettling paper scraps crumpled up amonst the
        <mark>begonias</mark> provided sufficient grounds to search the premise while a propper warrant was rushed through<sup>.</sup> Once inside, the
        the building appeared to be abandoned. <mark>No sign of the family</mark> that was supposed to be living there. <i>I</i>n<b>s</b>te<sub>a<em>d</em></sub> the officers
        found <em>pa<sup>p</sup>ers</em>. Stacks and stacks of them covered in the most horrificly distorted text imaginable. <del title="The public shoudl be kept in the dark on this part, we don't want a public panic.">One person on the scene
        who wished to remain anonymous claims to have even seen glimpses of Comic Sans.</del> 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Needless to say, the building was burned and the surrounding area delclared unfit for human habitation. The city offered the
        nearby residences buyout offers and all <del>but one</del> were accepted. This comes right on the heels of tensions regarding a budget
        shortage<sub>,</sub> which this incident will not doubt be swept up in. <ins>Please see page 8B for the continuation of this story.</ins>

        <del title="HE PUT THE WARNING AT THE END OF THE DRAFT!>!>>!??!?? EWHAT THE HELL!! ">NOTE: Hey Susan, be careful while editing this one. The're are whispers about some kind of text formatting plague
        that infects the writing of all who interact with information regarding the incident. I'm sure it's all hooey, but be
        careful, alright? Take care. - Caldwell</del>
